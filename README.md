# ALIGN Eval Frontend

This is the frontend code for [ALIGN Eval](https://aligneval.com), a gamified platform to help you build and optimize LLM evaluators. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## What is ALIGN Eval?

ALIGN Eval helps you build better LLM evaluators through:
- ðŸŽ® A prototype game that makes building LLM-evaluators easy and fun
- ðŸ“Š Tools to evaluate your prompts against labeled data
- âœ¨ Semi-automatic optimization to improve your LLM-evaluators
- ðŸ”„ An iterative workflow to align annotators with AI output, and AI with annotator input

While framed as a game to build LLM evaluators, you can use ALIGN Eval to craft and optimize any prompt that does binary classification!
