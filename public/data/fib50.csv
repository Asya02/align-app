3,"Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Kulbhushan Jadhav was ""kidnapped"" and tried on ""concocted charges"".
Mr Jadhav was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of ""espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan"".
Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying.
India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress.
There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained.
Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in the restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran.
Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as ""an indefensible verdict"" and warned Pakistan to ""consider the consequences"".
Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do ""whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice"".
On Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death.
Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to ""plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan"".
He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution.
The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.
In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India.
It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad.
But executions for spying are rare. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying.

""They wanted bigger names I think, they took the lad [Di Matteo] and that is how it goes,"" Warnock said ahead of Cardiff's visit to Villa Park.
""I thought at the time that's their loss not mine.""
The 67-year-old continued: ''There were about five clubs I spoke to. You have to look at that when you get to my age.
""I would not be here if one or two of those things had cropped up, but I am really pleased I am here. It is probably fate.""
Warnock had discussions with a number of clubs in the summer, including Nottingham Forest, before joining Cardiff following the departure of Paul Trollope in October.
Trollope has since been appointed assistant manager at Brighton, replacing Colin Calderwood who left to join Bruce at Villa.
After sacking Di Matteo, who lasted just 12 games, Villa opted for former Hull manager Bruce just a week after Warnock had been installed at Cardiff.
Warnock thinks Bruce is the right man to bring success to Villa following their Premier League relegation as he is a similar manager to himself.
''With Steve and myself you get what you see. I was disappointed I did not get a chance with Villa in the summer if I'm honest, because I thought it would have been ideal to sort everything out,"" Warnock told BBC Wales.
""That is why I am not surprised at all Steve has gone in and done really well.

He defended ""the limited and necessary self-defence facilities"" on islands inhabited by Chinese personnel as ""consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection.... under the international law"".
China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes.
But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised.
The South China Sea dispute has been a topic of debate at a meeting of South East Asian regional leaders in California.

Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years.
Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the US says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at China.

He defended ""the limited and necessary self-defence facilities"" on islands inhabited by Chinese personnel as ""consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection.... under the international law"".
China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes.
But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised.
The South China Sea dispute has been a topic of debate at a meeting of South East Asian regional leaders in California.
US President Barack Obama said the members had discussed the need for ""tangible steps"" to reduce tensions.
Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years.
Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the US says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at China.
The frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences.",Mr Kerry says the US is seriously concerned about increased Chinese militarisation in the contested South China Sea.,

Mr Joyce has also faced criticism from some politicians who say he should not take a political stance on behalf of the airline.
However, he said his company ""would be active out there"" in campaigning.
""I believe we have to get behind it and make sure that we have a 'yes' vote and certainly I will be out there strongly campaigning for a 'yes' vote,"" he said.
""We believe the social issues are very important of all of your [company] stakeholders and are very important for this country.""

If it shows support for changing Australia's Marriage Act, it is expected that a vote in parliament will follow. However, MPs would not be bound to vote in line with the public.
Mr Joyce was one of 20 company chief executives who signed a petition in March calling on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to legalise same-sex marriage.
It led to criticism by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who said it was ""unacceptable that people would use companies and the money of publicly-listed companies to throw their weight around"".
""If Alan Joyce and any other CEO wants to campaign on this or any other issue in their own time and on their own dime, good luck to them,"" Mr Dutton said at the time.

35,"Spending on the NHS should also be paid for by a dedicated tax marked on every payslip, the former health minister suggested.
Under Mr Lamb's plan, taxes would not be increased as the new levy would be offset by deductions to income tax or national insurance.
He has warned the NHS faces collapse without an urgent cash injection.
The plans are not yet party policy and will not be put to this year's conference in Bournemouth.
But Mr Lamb, the party's health spokesman, told party members he was ""very interested in the idea of a dedicated NHS and care contribution - separating it out from the rest of taxation, clearly identified on your payslip.
""And I am really interested in the idea of the right for local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care if they choose.""
The Lib Dems say he would like to implement the ideas across the UK, although, as health and social care are devolved, it is unclear how this would be enforced.
Mr Lamb - who lost out to Tim Farron in a leadership election in July - proposes a cross-party commission to explore the ideas. He intends to consult health bodies and professionals, patients, trade unions and academics.
Ministers have pledged £2bn in this financial year for the NHS, and an extra £8bn by 2020.
But Mr Lamb told the BBC that this was insufficient and, having ""seen the books"" as a minister in the last government, he feared the NHS could face a funding shortfall of £30bn by 2020.
""The bottom line is with rising demand because of an ageing population we need more investment,"" he said.
Mr Lamb also warned that the social care system was ""on its knees"" and could collapse without a cash injection of £5bn.
""I've been in the department. I have seen the books and I am deeply concerned. If we carry on regardless, the system will crash.""
Taxpayers are already shown how much they have contributed to the health service in annual personal tax statements.

""And it's why we are increasing student places for the fifth year in a row, targeting them at areas where they are needed most such as Aberdeen and Highlands and Islands universities.
""We have upped last year's student teacher targets for science, technology, engineering and maths and we know these will be challenging for the universities to meet.
""I will be asking the new Strategic Board for Teacher Education to look at our workforce planning, particularly in the secondary sector, to consider whether there is more we can do.
""We also launched a teacher recruitment campaign in September with a focus on the Stem subjects and we are working with the universities to maximise its impact.""",The Scottish government has announced a record number of student teacher places for the next financial year.,
